               <hr>
               <p>We believe in the necessity of community, and as such are proud to source all locally-available 
                high-quality ingredients from businesses in the surrounding areas.

                <h3>Premium Imports</h3>
               <hr>
               <p>Some ingredients cannot be sourced locally, which is why we carefully decide which suppliers to obtain them 
                from, as quality is foremost in our decision-making process. This results in only purchasing from the 
                most reputable foreign suppliers to ensure the quality our products is second to none. </p>

               <hr>
               <p>Safeguarding our environment is the key to our planet's future. We make sure to do our part and rely 
                solely on renewable energy sources such as wind power locally
                sources to power all of our sites' machinery and infrastructure.

                Keeping up to date with the latest technologies may seem like a tough challenge At Breifne Bakery we always

               <hr>
               <p>Over the 30+ years we have been in the food manufacturing industry we have always strived to expand in a controlled 
                manner. Our belief that everyone deserves to eat food which they love is what has always driven us to seek to provide 
                this opportunity to as many as possible.
