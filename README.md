# Breifne Bakery

Breifne Bakery is a site for potential customers of the fictional company Breifne Bakery. It allows the visitor to gleam an idea into what Breifne Bakery is, what they provide, and if there is any opportunity for employment. 
It will be useful to the visitor as while the name alone might not fully signify what the company is focused on, after visiting the site they will have a very clear understanding that this is a pizza manufacturing business.

## Testing 

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your project’s features and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.


### Validator Testing 

- HTML
  - No errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fcode-institute-org.github.io%2Flove-running-2.0%2Findex.html)
- CSS
  - No errors were found when passing through the official [(Jigsaw) validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fvalidator.w3.org%2Fnu%2F%3Fdoc%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fcode-institute-org.github.io%252Flove-running-2.0%252Findex.html&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en#css)

### Unfixed Bugs

- A minor unfixed bug is when viewing the index page on a landscape mobile device, the final image is slightly shorter than the rest. This may be due to the use of the "vh" sizing unit which caused diffiiculty when implementing responsive design. All of the other cases where such an issue ocurred were resolved, however despite my testing I could not get the image to respond to any of my "height" selectors and values in the correct manner.
